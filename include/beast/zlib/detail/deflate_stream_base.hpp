        There are 4 reasons for limiting lit_bufsize to 64K:
          - frequencies can be kept in 16 bit counters
          - if compression is not successful for the first block, all input
            data is still in the window so we can still emit a stored block even
            when input comes from standard input.  (This can also be done for
            all blocks if lit_bufsize is not greater than 32K.)
          - if compression is not successful for a file smaller than 64K, we can
            even emit a stored file instead of a stored block (saving 5 bytes).
            This is applicable only for zip (not gzip or zlib).
          - creating new Huffman trees less frequently may not provide fast
            adaptation to changes in the input data statistics. (Take for
            example a binary file with poorly compressible code followed by
            a highly compressible string table.) Smaller buffer sizes give
            fast adaptation but have of course the overhead of transmitting
            trees more frequently.
